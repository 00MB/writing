# Hackathons: Strengths and Weaknesses - May 2021

**Hackathons are great, they tick all the boxes for a good way to spend time.**

Note: if you are in a hackathon management team or are looking to start one, I recommenced reading [Your Hackathon Sucks](https://michaelbeer.me/Your-Hackathon-Sucks-237a2704a647416497ebb4d297b45744).

If you are familiar with me then you are probably familiar with a hackathon, if not I will give you a quick summary. A hackathon is an event usually hosted by a college/university or high school. These events are simple, you and usually 3 others code/work on a project together over a small period of time (usually 24 - 28 hours). You then submit your project and the judges choose the winners. Usually these events are held in person, but due to covid all 2020/21 hackathons were online.

Sounds interesting right? But are these events worthwhile? Below I give my feedback and help answer any common questions.

### Pros

To start, hackathons are a great learning experience. Depending on what you create, you will often experiment with new technologies and learn about new concepts. Hackathons are also filled with sponsors that offer free credits and memberships to use their products in your project. The time span is also usually large enough for quick learners to learn some new skills. Hackathons are also really enjoyable, which helps increase retention and keeps you engaged, leading to a greater learning experience. To add, hackathons also have some really successful speakers which are great to listen to. Some of my favourites include Michael Seibel and Eben Upton.

Hackathons are also really productive. The short time limit of the event usually creates the perfect intensity for finishing your project and even achieving a [flow state](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>). This productivity is also supported by the competitive nature of hackathons. Hundreds of other teams are also participating so competing for prizes really pushes you to create the best project you can. These prizes are also really good, especially to broke students. Companies such as Google and Facebook offering cash prizes based around $200 - $1000+ per member, due to this I have even seen some people enter hackathons as a part time job.

Hackathons are perfect for meeting new people. Due to the 2020 season being online, people could attend online hackathons every week, from all around the world. This created really diverse events, with my teams locations usually consisting of 4 different continents. Everyone I meet has unique interests and passions but everyone shares a common interest in creating new things. It might be quite hard to get introverts to approach you, so I would recommenced approaching people and putting yourself out there. Hackathons are also full of events such as social events and meetups. Team forming is always an event, so you don't need to feel anxious about not having a team.

Finally, hackathons are really thought provoking. They help you "think out of the box", as any common idea can't win (or shouldn't imo). Hackathons are perfect opportunities to put your ideas to test and turn them into reality. You might even find that these projects can turn into potential business ideas or startups.

These are just a few of many advantages for hackathons, although there are some flaws.

### Cons

Hackathons are fairly intense, maybe too intense depending on the person. Most competitive teams stay up all night and even up to 40 hours coding and working on their projects, something that is not recommended by health experts. Hackathons can really mess up your sleep schedule, I even feel horrible the day after hackathons due to the poor sleep quality. They are also pretty demanding. The hackathon will be your main focus over the time span, which is not the best if you have other activities to attend, such as studying.

Major hackathons are not very beginner friendly. The barrier to entry is pretty high, I mean for one it is probably required that you can code. Sure, you can design, but you will find it much more worthwhile and have an easier time finding team mates if you can code. Hackathons can also seem quite daunting to newcomers. During my first couple hackathons I did not actually submit a project, and instead just observed and learned about the process and attended some side events. There are also hackathons specific to beginners which you can find although they are not as common.

To enter hackathons you usually need to be a student, or in a certain age range. Some hackathons are 18+, while others require you to be in high school. Most hackathons don't allow any full time developers, although you can find some longer hackathons that are more suited for professionals on Devpost. If you really wan't to attend the hackathon, you should not be put off by the age limits, they usually don't check and you can just lie, but you did not hear that from me!

To summarise, hackathons are great events for productivity and meeting new people, although you might find it easier to sit back for your first couple events until you learn the ropes.
