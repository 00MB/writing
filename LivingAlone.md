# Living alone - April 2021

**Living alone is hard, like really hard. Probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.**

Before I start writing I just want to emphasise that I am a very stoic person. I really don’t like talking about myself and my emotions, especially when there are people that have been affected by covid much greater than I have. Right now thousands of people are dying in India every day due to the health services being overwhelmed. They are dying on the street while I sit in a warm, modern apartment writing this. If I fail university I will not starve to death, others do not have the same privilege.

The last 5 months have been the worst of my life, by “worst” I am referring to my happiness level. As personal growth goes it has been pretty good, I worked on my first startup, met a bunch of cool people online and have won several hackathon competitions leading to an overall improvement in my coding abilities. I have been improving, but my mental health has significantly depreciated. This all started prior to attending university.

When you are in high school, you hear great things about university. I was very excited for my first year, the societies, social events, high teaching quality, but most of all meeting new people. I have always been known to be fairly quiet and would agree that I have pretty poor social skills, I definitely seem to find it hard to make friends, but I thought this would be fine with all the social events happening. As freshers week goes, my first week was terrible (which was expected due to covid). Although there were some parties, I would decline these due to them being illegal/unethical at such a time as this was during covid laws. I did not make any friends, but at least I had my flat mates. My flat mates were all fairly different and I would not say I was friends with any of them but at least it was activity, human presence.

My very first semester of university was a fairly poor experience. All teaching was online and I think many people found it hard to keep motivation. I started slacking and not attending lectures as they did not seem time efficient, but this created a terrible habit. I would spend my free time procrastinating and when exams came round I was very unprepared. I still managed to do fairly well and pass my classes but I was still unachieved as a first year and still without (in person) friends. At least I had my flat mates.

The second lock-down started around December, by that time half of my flat mates had left and it was very quiet, I would only see my remaining flatmates once a day. By mid December they all decided to go back for Christmas. Due to my independent nature, I don’t really have as strong a connection to my family than most (by choice) and in turn only visited for 2 days, spending my 18th birthday without friends, which is never a good thing. After Christmas I was living by myself, which initially I enjoyed but as I found out gets exponentially worse (a rough graph is displayed below).

During the next 4 months I lived in isolation. This was not just "living alone", this was pure isolation, I think I went at least a month without speaking to anyone in real life. The closest human interaction I would have was the convenience stores, monk level stuff. This was a pretty dark time for me. The world almost felt dystopian, everything just got worse. These essential habits for productivity such as a good sleeping schedule, daylight, exercise, just fell apart. Once I fell behind in university it was very hard to keep up and instead I just procrastinated. So much impact from just one feeling, loneliness.

I remember my final exam, the 26th of April. The course material was fairly similar to what I was learning last year so I thought I would be relatively okay, and if not I would just cheat like what seemed like the majority of students were doing. I opened the exam paper and it was very similar to last year, but I just froze. I knew nothing. I would have to cheat to pass this exam.

I thought about it. Cheating. I could just be another 1 in the large student database. I could just pass under the radar and have nothing to worry about for the summer. But what use is cheating to me? My current life revolves around learning, not FAANG, not studying abroad in ivy leagues, not a first, not bragging rights, not LinkedIn, not a perfect resumé. I could not care less about the consequences of being caught cheating, they do not scare me. The only thing that scares me is the thought of not learning. Are the chances of me getting a FAANG internship greater with better grades? Probably. Will I learn if I cheat? No. From my eyes the decision seemed obvious. So that is what I did. I answered one easy question I remembered how to do and submitted it after 10 minutes.

The moment I submitted that exam was the moment I felt unlocked, free from any deadlines (sounds really cheesy but it is a feeling that is best described this way). This was also the day the second lock-down ended. I was still very anxious about the uncertainty of the future of my studies at  university (and still am today) so I called a support line and told them everything. This was the first time in 5 months I had any form of 2 way communication involving my mental health (I usually just write to a journal). That conversation was the first step to recovering from my 5 month isolation. This was followed by a walk with some self reflection (sounds cringe I know). These simple actions rebounded my mental health to a level stable enough to start studying, redeveloping my habits, creating discipline etc. I started reading more, studying the subject for which the test I failed. I was finally driven after all this time. My procrastination had gone, no more hard deadlines. Like I said I felt free.

And here I am today, writing this. Nearly a month after my last exam and I am slowly redeveloping my old habits which got me into this university in the first place. One of my flatmates came back, which was a great feeling. I am still yet to be informed about the resit process, but hopefully I will be able to retake the exam as I am confident due to my current studying that not only will I pass, but have one of the biggest score differences imaginable. I am currently on the waiting list for university counselling although I am unsure that I will need it anymore.

I would argue that this worst period of my life has also been one of my best learning experiences. I am a very big believer in the idea of either winning or learning. During this "rock bottom" period I have learned a lot about myself and the brain as a whole. Mainly I have developed a drive, something that has been capping my productivity for as long as I have known. Like I mentioned at the start, I am extremely lucky for my current "rock bottom" to be substantially higher than even some people's ceilings. I hope to repay this some day, to help make the chance of opportunity equal for all.
