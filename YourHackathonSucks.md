# Your Hackathon Sucks - May 2021

**Hackathons are fun but there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially with judging.**

Note: if you are reading this you are probably familiar with the idea of a hackathon, if not I recommenced reading [Hackathons: Strengths and Weaknesses](https://michaelbeer.me/Hackathons-Strengths-and-Weaknesses-bc8ef328770f4082b9ba1e5e3978adb8).

Just before we start, why should you listen to me? To be honest, this topic is pretty subjective and opinion-based. I have tried to remove this bias as much as possible by talking to over 50 participants and organisers about their views. I also published a survey to help support my recommendations with actual facts. This data was collected from NeuralWorks, a community of hackathon participants from all levels that I created, you can join this [here](https://discord.gg/UQBybs4X8H).

## The Idea of A True Hackathon

I love hackathons, they are great. But obviously, some are more successful than others. So what makes a hackathon great? What should you add to your hackathon to make it "not suck"? First, we need to understand what hackathons are actually for. Now we understand the objective of a hackathon, we need to understand who actually attends your hackathons. This can be broken down into 3 key categories: beginners, competitors and sponsors.

## What Beginners Want

Let's start with beginners. This includes people who are new to hackathons and have most likely never attended one. Beginners usually make up a large proportion of your participants, and if you are hosting with a university/college then most of them will be from there (assuming your event is online). Beginners can be competitors, but most likely the teams that win your hackathon will be attending hackathons around the world every weekend, this is almost a part-time job for them - and pays like one! Most beginners do not have a team and sometimes do not even create a project at all, some just attend the events and sponsor talks so don't expect much from them.

As I said, most beginners don't really care about winning. They are here for 3 main reasons, to learn, make friends and have fun. The main fears for beginners are the fear of being inexperienced (imposter syndrome) and the fear of not having a team. Remember, most have never even experienced a hackathon, so they don't know anything about team formation and submitting a project. This is what usually creates high ghosting rates for hackathons, beginners that do not know where to start. Making sure your hackathon includes fun events and a clear path for beginners is a must for creating a successful hackathon. I recommend having one or two organisers specifically on making a great environment for beginners, both before and during the event.

## What Competitors Want

You will most likely have a small proportion of hackers that are pros at this stuff, they have been to nearly every hackathon with the same team every time. They know the ins and out's and are most likely to win your hackathon prizes. You can find out if they are a competitor by viewing their Devpost profile. They do hackathons for mainly 2 reasons: win and to make friends.

Let's start with the basics. Who is actually attending your hackathon? Students. What do we know about students? Well, chances are you are one.

Most of this is fine, but some teams cross the line. I have seen FULL TIME google devs in teams competing against high schooler's. This

## The biggest flaws

Generally, the prizes for hackathons are great and do not need to be changed, the judging system on the other hand is totally flawed and needs to be changed. The current judging system used by most hackathons follows a "pick and choose" approach, where they get some biased judges to look at your presentation, and usually just pick the nicest UI. Remember the core idea of a hackathon is for learning and innovation, these projects are just copies of copies with nice UI's and a flashy presentation. Most of the time your project is seen by one
