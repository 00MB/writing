# Threats and the idea of a social contract.

**2 great ways to create a habit is through adding a consequence for failing to finish a task (threat) and connecting the task with other people (social contract).**

## The Problem

A goal among most people is to wake up earlier. This makes sense right. Why would you not want to maximise the number of hours in your day? Sure, some argue that we live in a "sleep-deprived society", but I am not here to talk about the science of sleep, I am here to talk about habits. I definitely need to wake up earlier and if you are reading this then chances are you do too, so I will use this as an example.

Waking up earlier is a habit. If you are not familiar with the idea of a habit you can view my writings on habits [here](https://michaelbeer.me/). All you really need to know is that they are not easy to create. Waking up early one day is not hard, waking up early every day for a year is. But how can make habit creation easier?

## Creating a Threat

Think about a task that you do not enjoy doing. A good example of this could be homework - most students do not enjoy completing homework, but most of the time they do it anyway. Imagine if that homework was optional. You would probably not complete it. This may seem like common sense, but this is a clear example of adding a threat. The threat in this example is failing the test, the school contacting your parents, or whatever the consequence from not submitting the homework is. This seems to be the one factor between not doing a task and successfully completing it.

Some problems arise though. This threat needs to be a hard barrier, something that is completely cheat-proof. Your brain works by trying to find the quickest way to deal with this threat. Usually, the quickest way is by cheating. Let's go back to the homework example. The quickest way to complete your homework is usually to cheat and use someone else's work. This is how cheating works, if it was easier to do the homework yourself you would choose to do so. Your brain chooses the easiest option, in this case, the easiest option is to cheat. How do we solve this though? How do we create a hard barrier? One solution is what is called a social contract.

## The Social Contract

To put it simply, a social/habit contract is a connection created between your task and an outside party (usually a friend). James Clear explains this well: "A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you donâ€™t follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you". A good example of this in use is live streamers. Although not intentionally, live streamers have a social contract with their viewers that they will go live at a certain time. The viewers hold them accountable, they are expecting that the streamer goes live and if they do not, they are less likely to stay and watch. Without this idea, I could not imagine streamers would be very consistent.

## Putting These Ideas in Action

As I said, I am terrible at waking up. How can I solve this using the ideas just discussed? One idea came to mind. Can I make a script that checks if I am on my computer during certain hours of the night? This sounds like a good idea, but I could not think of a way for a server to check my computer is on without using computational power on my own computer. So I thought, what do I do on my computer during the night? One thing I do is talk to people on Discord. I could make a discord bot that makes sure I am not online at certain hours of the night and makes sure I come online during a 15-minute window at 5am. This is the social contract, but what about the threat?

The threat I chose was the threat of losing money. This discord bot would connect to my PayPal and send a payment of $5 every time I failed to wake up. But who would I send it to? I do not want to donate it to charity otherwise I would not feel bad about spending my money, nor do I want to donate to terrorist organisations, so I needed a middle ground. I decided to donate it to a friend. This bot displays my progress to everyone on my NeuralWorks group, so others can motivate me and keep me accountable. So far this works very well and I have been meeting my 5am wake up goal. I plan to integrate a running API such as Strava to check if I have ran every day. You can view the code for this on the [NeuralWorks GitHub](https://github.com/NeuralWorksAI/5am-bot.).

This is just an example of how threats and social contracts can be used to help create habits. For more information on habit creation and productivity, I suggest you read [Core Habits and Jenga Blocks](https://michaelbeer.me/Core-Habits-and-Jenga-Blocks-07907fe6cbe64442b0801509d10b4d98).
