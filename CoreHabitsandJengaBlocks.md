# Core Habits and Jenga Blocks - May 2021

**Most habits are built on top of smaller yet more essential "core" habits.**

If you are interested by productivity like me, you have probably read a number of books in the productivity space such as "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, or "Deep Work" by Cal Newport to name a few. These books are great but they seem to assume that you are in an unproductive yet stable position. But some readers are different - I was one of them. Some readers do not have these core habits that most humans posses, such as a normal sleeping schedule, regular exercise, spending time outside etc. These habits are commonly known to have a significant effect on all humans, regardless of their goal - this is why I call them "core habits". Let me give you a better example.

Imagine a Jenga tower (image above). Each of these wooden blocks would represent a habit, with your goal associated habits such as learning Chinese, studying for 2 hours a day etc making up the majority of the tower. Now imagine we have our essential habits, like I just discussed these are usually found in every human and include things such as a sleeping schedule etc. These habits represent the core, foundation blocks of the tower, I hope you see where this is going. If I was to remove one these fundamental blocks I would most likely cause the tower to fall over just like core habits. If I was to remove one of these core habits from my life for whatever reason, lets say I start waking up really late, chances are all of my goal related habits such as studying will fall with it. To put it simply, for me maintain my studying habits (goal habit) I need to I need to have a good sleeping schedule (core habit).

I don't think many people realise this idea. From all the productivity books and courses I have listened to, I have never heard this topic come up. I think a big reason many people fail to create good habits is because they are missing one of these core habits and do not realise its importance. If you are trying to build your Jenga tower with weak foundations, it is certain at some point your tower will fall.

### Notes

Another reason people fail to create habit is due to setting unreasonable first goals. You can read about this below.
